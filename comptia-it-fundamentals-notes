# CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)

## Hardware Fundamentals (Computer Innards)
### Core Internal Components
### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Brain of the computer
- Executes instructions from software
- Clock speed (GHz) measures performance
### Motherboard
- The main circuit board that connects all components
- Houses the CPU socket, RAM slots, expansion slots, and chipset
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Short-term memory used while a computer is on
- Contents are lost when powered off
### Storage Drives
- HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Magnetic spinning disks; slower but cheaper
- SSD (Solid State Drive): No moving parts, much faster
- NVMe: A newer SSD standard that connects directly to the motherboard for high-speed data transfer
### Power Supply (PSU): Converts AC wall power to DC for internal components
### Cooling Systems: Fans, liquid cooling, and heat sinks keep components from overheating
### External Peripherals (Plug-ins)
- Input Devices: Keyboard, Mouse, Barcode Scanners, Microphones
- Output Devices: Monitors, Speakers, Printers
- Storage Devices: Flash Drives, External Hard Drives
- Ports & Connectors: USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, DisplayPort, Ethernet, Audio Jack, Thunderbolt
### Hardware Maintenance
- Always ground yourself to prevent (electro)static discharge (ESD)
- Keep dust away using compressed air
- Never touch connector pins or open power supplies

## Software Fundamentals
### Operating Systems (OS)
- Windows: common in business environments
- macOS: used in design and creative fields
- Linux: open-source, used in servers and cybersecurity
- Mobile OS: Android and iOS
### File Systems: NTFS (Windows), APFS (macOS), EXT4 (Linux)
### Applications: Programs that perform tasks (Office, Chrome, Adobe apps)
### Utilities: System tools like antivirus software, file compression, and defragmentation

## Networking Basics
- IP Address: Numeric label that identifies a device on a network (IPv4: 192.168.1.1, IPv6: long alphanumeric)
- Router: Directs network traffic and connects to the internet (Sends traffic between networks)
- Switch: Connects multiple devices in a LAN
- MAC Address: Unique hardware-level identifier for network cards
- LAN (Local Area Network): Covers a small area like an office or home
- WAN (Wide Area Network): Connects multiple LANs, e.g., the internet
- Firewall: Monitors and filters network traffic for security
- DNS (Domain Name System): Translates website names (like google.com) to IP addresses
- DHCP: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices

## Security Basics
- Passwords: Should be long, unique, and complex (mix of letters, numbers, symbols)
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA): Adds extra verification beyond passwords
### Malware Types
- Virus: attaches to programs
- Worm: spreads without user action
- Trojan: disguises as legitimate software
- Ransomware: encrypts data until paid
### Best Practices
- Regular updates, firewalls, and antivirus scans

## Data & Software Development Basics
- Data: Stored in bits (0s and 1s). 1 byte = 8 bits
- Databases: Organized systems that store and retrieve data (e.g., SQL)
### Programming Concepts
- Variables, loops, and conditional statements
- Common languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS basics
- Scripts automate tasks, like batch file cleanups
