# Memory
## DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module)
- 64 bit data width
- electrical contacts are different on each side
## SO-DIMM (Small Outline DIMM)
- used in laptops and mobile devices
- almost half the length of a DIMM
## DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)
- the memory on a DIMM (the black components)
- dynamic (needs constant refreshing)
- random access (any storage location can be accessed directly)
## SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM)
- synchronous with the system clock
## DDR3 SDRAM
- twice the data rate of DDR2, and a larger chip capacity
- no backwards compatibility
## DDR4 SDRAM
- speed increases over DDR3
- maximum size of 64 GB per DIMM
- no backwards compatibility
## DDR5 SDRAM
- faster data transfers than previous DDR SDRAM versions
- maximum size of 64 GB per DIMM
- no backwards compatibility
## Virtual Memory
- in Windows, configure in "Performance Options"
- an area of your HDD or SSD that Windows can use as if it were actual memory
- slower than RAM
- can be automatically managed by the OS, with some configuration settings available
## Multi-Channel Memory
- increases throughput by spreading the load across multiple memory modules
- memory combinations should match
## Parity Memory
- adds an additional parity bit
- won't always detect an error
- can't correct an error
## ECC (Error Correcting Code) Memory
- detects errors and corrects them
- not compatible with all systems
- looks the same as non ECC memory
