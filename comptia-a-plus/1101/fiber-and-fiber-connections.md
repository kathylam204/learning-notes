# Fiber and Fiber Connectors
## Fiber Communication
- transmission by light
- no radio frequencies (can't be intercepted)
- transmission over long distances
## Multimode Fiber
- used for short-range communications (up to 2 km)
- uses a relatively inexpensive light source (often LEDs)
## Single-Mode Fiber
- used for long-range communications (up to 100km without needing to regenerate the signal)
- more expensive light source than multimode fiber (often lasers)
## LC (Local Connector)
## ST (Straight Tip) Connector
## SC (Subscriber Connector)
