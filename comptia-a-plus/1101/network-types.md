# Network Types
## LAN (Local Area Network)
- a group of devices in the same broadcast domain
- usually contains devices in your building or in a group of buildings nearby
- high-speed connectivity, typically provided by ethernet and 802.11 wireless networks
## WAN (Wide Area Network)
- spans the globe
- generally connects LANs across a distance
- much slower than LAN
- can be terrestrial or non-terrestrial
## MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- larger than a LAN, smaller than a WAN
- common to see government ownership
## SAN (Storage Area Network)
- extends local drives to a centralized form of storage
- looks and feels like a local storage device
- block-level access
- requires a lot of bandwidth
## WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)
- uses 802.11 technologies
- short range
- typically used within a building or in a localized area
- can expand coverage with access points
## VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
- a group of devices in the same broadcast domain, separated logically, instead of physically
## VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- encrypted data traversing a public network
- connected to a concentrator device
- often integrated into a firewall
- may use specialized cryptographic hardware or be software based
- may be used with client software, or built into the OS
## Client-To-Site VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- on demand access from a remote location
- software connects to the VPN concentrator
- may be configured as always-on
