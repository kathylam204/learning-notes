# Internet Connection Types
## Satellite Networking
- uses a satellite dish to communicate with a satellite in low earth orbit
- non-terrestrial communication (high cost)
- common speeds of 50 megabits per second, down, and 3 megabits per second, up
- high latency
- high frequencies
- operates over line of site
## Fiber Networking
- high speed data communication
- higher installation cost than copper
- allows for communication over long distances
## Cable Broadband Networking
- uses a cable television cable
- use data, voice, and video over the same connection
- supports high-speed networking
- common speeds of 50 megabits per second through 1000+ megabits per second
- broadband (can send multiple streams of data across a single wire by communicating across multiple frequencies on that wire)
## DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) Networking
- in most cases, ADSL (Asymmetric DSL)
- common speeds of 200 megabits downstream, and 20 megabits per second upstream
- about a 1000 foot limitation from the central office
- uses telephone lines
## WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) Networking
- terrestrial internet using wireless
- speeds can range from about 10 megabits per second to 1000 megabits per second
