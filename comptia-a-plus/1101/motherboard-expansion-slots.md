# Motherboard Expansion Slots
## Conventional PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)
- parallel communication
- many expansion options
- 32-bit and 64-bit (support different widths, as well as different voltages)
## PCIe (PCI Express)
- replaces the PCI standard
- communicates serially using unidirectional serial lanes
- more lanes support more data
- may have x1, x2, x4, x16, or x32 full-duplex lanes
