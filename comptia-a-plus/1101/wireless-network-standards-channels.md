# Wireless Network Standards & Channels
## 802.11a
- one of the original 802.11 wireless standards
- operates in the 5 Ghz range, or other frequencies with special licensing
- 54 megabits per second speeds
- smaller range than 802.11b, which operates in the 2.4 Ghz range (due to the higher, 5 Ghz frequency being absorbed by objects in the way)
- not commonly seen today
## 802.11b
- also one of the original 802.11 wireless standards
- operates in the 2.4 Ghz range
- 11 megabits per second speeds (much slower than 802.11a)
- better range than 802.11a, due to less absorption problems
- more frequency conflict (less channels)
- not commonly seen today
## 802.11g
- an upgrade to 802.11b
- operates in the 2.4 Ghz range
- 54 megabits per second speeds (similar to 802.11a)
- backwards compatible with 802.11b (802.11b devices are compatible with an 802.11g network)
- 2.4 Ghz frequency conflict issues
## 802.11n (WiFi 4)
- upgrade from 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g
- operates at both 5 Ghz and 2.4 Ghz
- 40 megahertz channel width
- maximum theoretical speeds of 600 megabits per second, when using 40 Mhz mode and 4 antennas
- introduced MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), which allows devices to transfer much more information simultaneously, between the end station and the access point
## 802.11ac (WiFi 5)
- significant improvements over 802.11n
- operates in the 5 Ghz range
- up to 160 Mhz channel bandwidth
- introduced denser signaling modulation (faster data transfers)
- 8 MU-MIMO (Multi User MIMO) downlink streams, for nearly 7 gigabits per second maximum total speeds
## 802.11ax (WiFi 6)
- the successor to 802.11ac
- operates at 5 Ghz and 2.4 Ghz
- 20, 40, 80, and 160 Mhz channel widths (total possible throughput of about 1201 megabits per second, per channel)
- 8 bi-directional MU-MIMO streams, for nearly 10 gigabits per second maximum total speeds
- introduced orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) (works similarly to cellular communication, and improves high-density installations)
