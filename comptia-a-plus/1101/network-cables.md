# Network Cables
## Twisted Pair Copper Cabling
- common for ethernet connections
- balanced pair operation
- each cable has equal and opposite signals
- the twist keeps a single wire constantly moving away from the interface
- pairs in the same cable have different twist rates
## CAT5 and CAT5e Twisted Pair Copper Cabling
- 1 gigabyte standard
- 100 meter maximum supported distance
- CAT5e is enhanced CAT5
## CAT6 and CAT6A Twisted Pair Copper Cabling
- CAT6:
- 10 gigabyte standard
- 55 meter maximum supported distance for an unshielded cable, 100 meter maximum supported distance for a shielded cable
- CAT6A:
- augmented CAT6
- 10 gigabyte standard
- 100 meter maximum supported distance
## Coaxial Cable
- commonly used on cable modems, cable televisions, and high-speed internet over cable
- made of a wire conductor, dielectric insulator, metal shielding, and plastic jacket
## Plenum-Rated Cable
- fire resistant cable
- FEP (fluorinated ethylene polymer) or low smoke PVC
- may not be as flexible as PVC cabling
## STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
- additional shielding protects against interference
- shielding may be around each pair, or the whole cable
## U (Abbreviation)
- Unshielded
## S (Abbreviation)
- braided shielding
## F (Abbreviation)
- foil shielding
