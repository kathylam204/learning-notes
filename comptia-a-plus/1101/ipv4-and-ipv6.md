# IPv4 and IPv6
## IPv4 Addresses
- the primary protocol for everything that we do
- included in almost all configurations
- OSI layer 3 address
- 32 bits, or 4 bytes
- the maximum decimal value for each byte is 255
- example: 192.168.1.131
## IPv6 Addresses
- now part of all major operating systems
- the backbone of our internet infrastructure
- has a 128-bit address
- many more possible addresses versus IPv4
- hexadecimal format (long, we refer to these addresses by DNS and name)
## IPv4 Configuration Parameters
- unique IP address
- subnet mask
- default gateway
## Subnet Mask
- used by the local device to determine what subnet it's on
- masks out the IP address, leaving only the host address at the end
- for example, 255.255.255.0
## Default Gateway
- the IP address of a router that allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
- must be an IP address on the local subnet
- for example, 192.168.1.1
