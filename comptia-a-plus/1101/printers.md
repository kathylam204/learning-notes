# Printers
## Laser Printers
- combines a laser, high voltage, charged ions, powdered ink, heat, and paper
- fast and high quality, but complex
## Laser Printing Process (Simple)
- the image is drawn with a photosensitive drum using a later
- the drum picks up toner and transfers it to the paper
- the fuser assembly uses heat and pressure to melt the toner and to permanently bond it to the paper
## Laser Printing Process (Detailed)
- Processing
- build the entire page in memory
- Charging
- prepare the drum with a negative charged electrostatic charge
- Exposing
- write the image with the laser
- Developing
- add negatively charged toner to the imagining drum
- Transferring
- move the toner from the drum to the paper
- Fusing
- heat and pressure
- Cleaning
- remove excess toner
## Transfer Belt and Roller (Laser Printer)
- takes toner from individual colors and combines them into a single page
## Pickup Rollers
- picks up a single piece of paper
- works in conjunction with the separation pad
## Inkjet Printers
- relatively inexpensive and quiet
- provide color and high resolution
- use expensive, proprietary ink that eventually fades
## Ink Cartridges (Inkjet Printer)
- printer pulls from a set of cartridges and drops ink on the page
- Carriage and Belt (Inkjet Printer)
- moves ink cartridges over the paper
- the belt moves the carriage back and forth
## Thermal Printers
- feeds specially coated white paper in, heats certain parts of the page, and turns them black
- no ink is needed
- very quiet
- paper is very sensitive to light and heat
- adding tape to the paper makes it turn white
## Feed Assembly (Thermal Printer)
- pulls paper through the printer
- long cylinder with gears that turn
## Impact Printers
- use a print head with small matrix of pins, to press against a ribbon, and make a mark on the paper
- pins can be seen as dots
- great for multiple pages
- low cost per page (only need the ink inside the ribbon)
- Noisy
- poor graphics
## Printer Ribbon (Impact Printer)
- made of fabric
- one large ribbon
- constantly cycling
- contains the ink
## Tractor Feed (Impact Printer)
- pulls the paper through the printer
- continuous paper feed
- perforations between pages
- uses holes on the left and right sides of the paper, instead of using friction
## Resin Printing
- creates smooth and finely detailed 3D prints
- liquid resin is hardened using a light source (ultraviolet light or a laser)
- lasers are added on to the bottom
- the entire print hangs from the build platform
- resin must be handled and disposed of properly
