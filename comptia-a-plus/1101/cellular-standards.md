# Cellular Standards
## 2G Standards
- provided poor data support
- originally circuit-switched networks
- utilized multiplexing (multiple people can communicate at the same time, over the same frequencies)
- GSM (Global Systems for Mobile Communications):
- originally an EU standard
- 90% of the market
- worldwide coverage
- used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the US
- used a SIM card
- CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)
- each call uses a different code, used to filter on the receiving side
- used by Verizon and Sprint in the US
- handsets were controlled by the network provider
- not much worldwide utilization
## 3G Standard
- upgraded data connectivity over 2G
- had incremental updates that improved speeds
- maximum speeds of about several megabits per second
- new functionalities such as GPS, mobile TV, and VoD
## 4G Standard and LTE (Long Term Evolution)
- converged the GSM and CDMA standards
- supported download rates of 150 megabits per second
- LTE-A (the upgraded version of LTE) was available in some areas
## 5G Standard
- higher frequencies than the previous standards
- (eventually) 10 gigabits per second speeds
- (currently) 100 to 900 megabits per second speeds
- major IoT impact (less of a bandwidth constraint, larger data transfers, faster monitoring and notification, and additional cloud processing)
