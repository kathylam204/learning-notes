- centralized mobile device management with a specialized functionality (policies, access control, application access, corporate email configuration)
- control the entire device or a partition
- no user configuration needed
## Connectionless Protocols (Examples)
- DHCP
- Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
## Connection-Oriented Protocols (Examples)
- HTTPS
- SSH
## PoE Injector
- adds power to an ethernet cable

- 350 mA maximum current
## PoE+
- IEE 802.3at
- now also part of the 802.3 standard
- 25.5 watts DC power
- 600 mA maxiumum current
## PoE++
- IEEE 802.3bt
- 51 watts and 600 mA maximum current for type 3
- 71.3 watts and 960 mA max current for type 4
- PoE with 10GBASE-T
## Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
- changes physical networking infrastructure into a software based platform that can be used in the cloud
- has an infrastructure layer/data plane layer, control layer/control plane layer, and application layer/management plane layer
## Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA)
- responsible for control and management of industrial machines
- provides real-time information and system control
## Embedded Systems
- purpose-built devices
## Private IPv4 Address Range
- 10.0.0.0 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0 192.168.255.255
## Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) Range
- 169.254.0.1 169.254.255.254
## T568A (Image)
## T568B (Image)
## Motherboard Information Technology eXtended (ITX) Form Factor
- low power, small form factor
- screws compatible with ATX
## Server Motherboard Compatibility
- multisocket (splits the load)
- 4+ memory slots (typically)
- additional expansion slots
- designed for a rack-mounted system
## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- a specification for cryptographic functions
- hardware to help with encryption functions
- must be supported by the motherboard
- contains a cryptographic processor, persistent memory, versatile memory, and is password protected
- make changes in the BIOS
## Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- manages many cryptographic keys
- has cryptographic accelerators built in
- offload CPU overhead from other devices
- standalone device or an adapter card
## Redundant Power Supply
- two or more power supplies, that can individually handle the whole load
- normally runs 50% of the load
- Hot-swappable
## Printer Command Language (PCL) & PostScript
- how your printer communicates with your system
- PCL:
- common across the industry
- PostScript:
- usually used in high end printers
## 802.11 Infrastructure Mode
- 802.11 with an access point
- 802.11 Ad Hoc Mode
- 802.11 without an access point (direct link)
## Printer Share
- printer is connected to a computer and shares the printer
- the computer must be running to print
## Print Server
- usually software on the printer
- fully managed by the printer
- web-based front-end or client utility
## Network Scan Services (List)
- scan to email
- scan to folder (using smb, or send to a microsoft share)
- scan to cloud
## Jitter
- the time between frames on a network
- causes you to miss information
## Latency
- a delay between the request and the response
- waiting time
## Hypervisor Type 1
- bare metal
- runs directly on the host's hardware
## Hypervisor Type 2
- Guest-os
- runs as a software layer on an operating system
## Container Virtualization
- specialized version of a type 2 hypervisor
- allows services/applications to run within their own isolated cells/containers
