# Computer Power
## Computer Power Supply
- converts AC to DC
- 120V AC or 240V AC to 3.3V DC, 5V DC, and 12V DC
## Ampere (Amp)
- the rate of electron flow past a point in one second
## Voltage (Volt)
- electrical pressure pushing the electrons
## Power
- measured in Watts (measurement of real power use)
- volts x amps = watts
## AC (Alternating Current) VAC by Country
- US/Canada: 110 to 120 VAC, 60 Hz rate of alternation
- Europe: 220 to 240 VAC, 50 Hz rate of alternation
- use a power supply with a dual-voltage input option as voltage varies by country
## Power Supply Output
- +12V for most modern components
- +5V for legacy components
- +3.3V for M.2 slots, RAM slots, and motherboard logic circuits
- +5V (standby voltage, used when in hibernate mode)
- 12V for integrated LAN, older serial ports, some PCIe cards
- 5V for lsa adapter cards (may not always be provided by the power supply)
