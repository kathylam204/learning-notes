# TCP and UDP
## TCP and UDP
- transported inside of an IP packet
- encapsulated by the IP protocol
- two very common ways to move data from place to place
- operate at OSI layer 4, the transport layer
- add additional capabilities that IP, alone, can't provide, such as multiplexing (use many different applications at the same time)
## TCP (Acronym)
- Transmission Control Protocol
## UDP (Acronym)
- User Datagram Protocol
## TCP
- connection-orientated protocol
- uses a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection, making it a reliable protocol (has a built in system to verify receipt of data, can recover from errors, and can manage out-out-order messages or retransmissions)
- utilizes flow control (the receiver can manage how much data is sent)
## UDP
- connectionless protocol
- real-time communication (no way to stop and resend data)
- unreliable delivery
- no flow control (the sender determines how much data is transmitted)
