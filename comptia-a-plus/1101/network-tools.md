# Network Tools
## Cable Crimpers
- designed to add connectors to the end of a cable
- metal prongs are pushed through the insulation, and into the copper in the wire
## WiFi Analyzer
- listens to all of the signals on a wireless network and provides you with information on what frequencies are in use, and which ones might be open
- especially useful in an area with many access points
- may be purpose-built hardware or a device add-on
## Tone Generator
- traces wires
- connect to the end of the wire, and go to the other end, using the inductive probe to identify the wire, by the tone
## Loopback Plugs
- tests the interfaces of physical ports by connecting to the device
- typically is serial, using RS-232
- sends and receives information, then, compare the values to see if they match. (if they match, it's very likely an interface problem)
## Taps and Port Mirrors
- intercept network traffic and send a copy to a capture device
- physical taps:
- used to see data on a connection (going over the wire)
- disconnect the link, put a tap in the middle, and take a copy of data to send to an analyzer, or a monitor
- can be passive or active (passive requires fiber, active can use copper, but requires power)
- port mirrors:
- tapping functionality, built into switches
- software-based tap
- takes data that's going in between different switch interfaces, and sends a copy of that data to a third interface that you can connect to an analyzer, or a monitor
